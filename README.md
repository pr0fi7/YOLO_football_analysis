# YOLO Football Analysis

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing football videos using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection. It includes several modules designed to detect players, assign teams, estimate speed and distance, and track player movements. 

## Features
- **Player Detection:** Detects football players in video frames.
- **Team Assignment:** Assigns players to their respective teams.
- **Speed & Distance Estimation:** Calculates the speed and distance covered by players.
- **Camera Movement Estimation:** Estimates the movement of the camera to stabilize the video.
- **Player-Ball Assignment:** Determines which player is in possession of the ball.
- **Tracking:** Tracks the movements of players throughout the video.

## Installation
